Compilation:
  From the root of our project (where this file is located), run the following command to compile our program:
  > javac -d target -cp src/main/resources/jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar:src/main/resources/jackson-core-2.0.6.jar:src/main/resources/jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar src/main/java/softwaredev/purpleparrots/*.java src/main/java/softwaredev/purpleparrots/gui/*.java
  (or just use the compile script, also in the root directory)

Execution:
  From the root of our project (where this file is located), run the following command to run our GUI prototype:
  > java -cp src/main/resources/jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar:src/main/resources/jackson-core-2.0.6.jar:src/main/resources/jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar:target softwaredev.purpleparrots.gui.MyMBTAGui
  (or just use the run script, also in the root directory)
  You should see a purple Swing window pop up (has been tested both locally and X-forwarded from login.ccs.neu.edu).
  Click the only button on the main window, and you'll see the live locations of the trains on the orange, red, and blue lines.
